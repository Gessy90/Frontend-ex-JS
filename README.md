# Frontend Exercise 

## Technologies used

* JavaScript 
* HTML5 
* CSS 
* GitHub

## Steps to resolve the code test

* The first thing that I've done is to create a form with HTML and CSS.

* After that I moved onto the JavaScript and I wanted to use the first API to get some data so that I could move onto the second part of the exercise where the customer A and B will be able to register but unfortunately I've spent so much time trying to figure out why the API wasn't working that I didn't have time to complete the whole exercise. I have now found the mistake and I'll provide some pics. I was trying to get the text to the POST request as a JSON text while it was meant to be Form URL encoded. 


### This is the data received when I select Form URL Encoded

### This is the data when I select JSON Text

* I've decided to leave all my attempts to get the data from the POST request just to show you that I've tried multiple times. I do apologise that I didn't manage to complete the exercise.

## What I would have done differently
Next time I would not spend so much time in finding out if the API is working but I would rather focus my attention on the code and the logic behind it. This is a big lesson that I will remember forever.
